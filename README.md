The first steps you need to begin installing osTicket is to have an active Azure Virtural Machine installed and a Resource Group open. You'll have to play around with your reigonal location in order to find a size option that is applicable to you. Also make sure that you choose Windows 10 Pro in the Image section. When you have your selecions settled, just make a username and password, let Azure create its own subnet and IP, and we can move on to the next step.

After your done making the VM, we have to set up IIS for our VM. Open up the control panel in your VM, and go to Programs, then drop down World Wide Web Services, Application Development Features and check on CGI and Application Development Features. Then scroll and drop down Internet Information Services, Web Management Tools, IIS Management Console and check on ISS Managment Console. Now go back and double check if you have everything on before moving on to the next step
